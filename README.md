# UnityCoreLab

This is the place where I test my assets and learnings.

For now there are 3 SYNTY-Polygon asset packs included; Icons, Prototype & Sci-Fi. I will be using these for future testings on this project. I might add more onto this as I see it fit.

Currently the movement system of Rigidbody is being tested. It is already obvious that this type of movement will cause problems. The player object's rotations need to be fixed in order for it to not fall while moving. Thus preventing any creative ways of implementing game mechanics or animations. Improved movement solutions should be considered for all games.
