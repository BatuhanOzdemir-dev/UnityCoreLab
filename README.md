# UnityCoreLab

This is the place where I test my assets and learnings. The project currently runs on Unity 2021.3.0f1.

For now there are 3 SYNTY-Polygon asset packs included; Icons, Prototype & Sci-Fi. I will be using these for future testings on this project. I might add more onto this as I see it fit.

Currently the movement system of Rigidbody is being tested. It is already obvious that this type of movement will cause problems. The player object's rotations need to be fixed in order for it to not fall while moving. Thus preventing any creative ways of implementing game mechanics or animations. Improved movement solutions should be considered for all games.

On my latest addition, I tried implementing movement on the Input System. It went pretty well. I encountered some problems, which, when fixed gave me some really nice information. Now if I want to implement the Input System on any game, It'll take much less time.

Also I use Cinemachine for camera almost exclusively. In all my projects I opt to use it. I'm always learning more about Cinemachine. In this project, it is used for a third-person camera that can switch sides on the shoulders by pressing "H". Camera controls were set by code.
